# Italy Tours Platform — Network Build Status

Tracks build status per network property (see `apps/web/src/lib/tours.ts` →
`NETWORK_SITES` for the canonical registry). Numbering matches that
registry's `number` field, not build order.

## Status log

### 2026-09-12
- **05 · Street Food Rome — hero site build complete.** The platform's
  first hero implementation (`ACTIVE_NETWORK_SLUG`), fully built end-to-end:
  homepage, tour pages, category/neighbourhood hubs, blog, About/Contact/
  Privacy/Terms/FAQ, SEO/schema, and image audit. This is the reference
  build the shared platform modules (site registry, content model,
  affiliate cloaking, SEO engine) were proven out against, ahead of any
  other hero rolling out.
- **02 · Underground Colosseum — bespoke hero homepage + full page set
  built.** Custom-designed homepage (not the shared template), all 5 money
  pages and 6 support pages from the site's own blueprint, About, Contact,
  navbar with dropdown mega-menus + mobile menu, and cross-network footer/
  nav links. Not yet the platform's active/default site; reachable directly
  at `/underground-colosseum`.
- All other network properties (03, 04, 06–14) remain **not started** —
  each still resolves to the "under construction" placeholder
  (`UnderConstructionNotice`) at its root and every sub-path.
